               During this time please quarantine yourself at home. If for any reason you have to leave the house please wear a mask and take a small bottle of hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent of 100% alcohol.[2][3] Please only use hand sanitizers when there are no other supplements such as soap and water.

               <div class="alert alert-danger">
               Some people are trying to take advantage of the situation by making hand sanitizers that have 60% percent of alcohol that is not purely made of ethanol or ethyl alcohol. Some hand sanitizers can also include methanol and 1-propanol that can cause more health problems such as blindness, nerve damage, and death.[4] Please be careful before you buy. 
To take extra precautions you can also wear plastic gloves to prevent contact with the things other people would have touched.
